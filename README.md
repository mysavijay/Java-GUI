Development of a Java GUI for Mission Analysis
Airbus DS in-house satellite simulation tools produce a variety of complex output data. A comprehensive
 visualization both in 2D and 3D of these output data will ease the analysis and understanding of the results.
 Encompassing these visualizations and the control of the tools into a graphical user interface (GUI) makes
 our satellite simulation tools accessible to a broader range of users.
· Functional and ergonomic design of a UI to the specific needs of the simulation tool
· Integration of the UI in Java
· Development of an integrated interface between the UI and the simulation tool
· Software technologies shall be reviewed to allow for a direct interaction between the simulation tool and the
 UI
· Utilization of available open-source visualization tools
· 3D graphics animation to display objects/data required for mission analysis
